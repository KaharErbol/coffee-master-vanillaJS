# coffee-master-vanillaJS

This Single Page Application (SPA) is built entirely with **Vanilla JavaScript**, following a reactive programming pattern.

## Key Features

### ðŸš€ Reactive State Management
- State management is implemented using JavaScript `Proxy`, enabling automatic UI updates whenever state data changes.

### ðŸ§© Custom Web Components
- **Templates:** Defined within `index.html`.
- **Reusable Components:** Organized in the `Components` directory.
- **Encapsulation:** Components leverage the Shadow DOM for style isolation, modularity, and easy maintenance.

### ðŸ”€ Custom JavaScript Router
- Lightweight client-side routing to dynamically load components without full-page reloads.
- Seamless navigation handled through the browser's History API (`pushState`, `popstate`).
- Supports dynamic routing with URL parameters (e.g., `/product-123`).
- Automatically scrolls to the top of the page upon navigation for enhanced user experience.

## Result
This setup provides a modular, maintainable, and performant frontend experience without external libraries or frameworks.
